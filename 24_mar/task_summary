<!-- Here are three new JavaScript coding questions: -->

Question 1: Find the First Duplicate in an Array
Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the first duplicate element. If no duplicates are found, return -1.

Example:

- Input: [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2]
- Output: 3

Question 2: Check if a String is a Subsequence of Another String
Write a JavaScript function that takes two strings as input and returns true if the first string is a subsequence of the second string, and false otherwise.

Example:

- Input: "abc", "ahbgdc"
- Output: true

Question 3: Flatten a Nested Array
Write a JavaScript function that takes a nested array as input and returns a flattened array.

Example:

- Input: [1, [2, 3], [4, [5, 6]]]
- Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
